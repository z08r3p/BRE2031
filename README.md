Tutorial 3:Thermal Comfort and Thermal Load Estimation
1.       The ventilation heat loss   can be   determined   by:       Is   this   expression   used   for sensible heat loss or   latent heat   loss?
2.       List 5 parameters that affect thermal comfort   and   explain how they   affect   thermal   comfort.   List and explain 4 types of   local   thermal   discomfort.
3.       What is thermal load? Give 3   examples   of   thermal load.
4.       The   external   wall   of   a   room   measures   4.8m   by   2.6m   and   has   an   average   age   U-value   1.8W/m2   K. the indoor   air temperature is 21oC,   the   mean   radiant   temperature   is   18   oC,   and   the outdoor air   temperature   is   0   oC.
(a)   Calculate the environmental temperature inside the room.   (19oC)
(b)   Use   the   environmental   temperature   to   calculate   the   rate   of heat   loss   through   the   wall.   (427W)
5.      A   house   has   a   floor   area   of 92   m2      and   a   ceiling   height   of 2.5m.   The   average   indoor   air   temperature is kept at 18    oC, the outdoor air temperature is 6    oC,      and    the      average   infiltration rate is   1.5 air changes per hour.   The volumetric   specific heat   capacity   of   the   air   is   1300 J/m3K.

(b)   Calculate   the   cost   of the   heat   energy   lost   during   24   hours   if the   above   conditions   are   maintained and replacement heat cost 7 pence per mega-joule. (904 pence)
6.      A   sports pavilion   has   internal   dimensions   of   11m×4m×3m   high.   20   percent   of the   wall   area   is   glazed   and the   doors   have   a total   area   of 6m2.   The U-values   in   W/m2      K   are: walls   1.6,    windows    5.5,    doors      2.5,      roof      1.5,      and      floor      0.8.      The      indoor      air      temperature      is   maintained   at   18   oC   when   the   outdoor   air   temperature   is   -2   oC.   There   are   four   air   changes   per   hour   and   the   volumetric   specific   heat   capacity   of air   is    1300   J/m3K.   The   heat   gains   total 2200W.

(b)   Calculate the surface area of   the radiators required to maintain the   internal   temperature under   the   above    conditions.    The    output   of   the   radiators    is   440   W/m2 of   radiating   surface area.   (18.25m2)
7.      A room has   7.5m2    area   of single-glazed windows,   which   have   a   U-value   of 5.6W/m2K.   It is proposed to   double-glaze the windows   and   reduce   the   U-value   to   3.0   W/m2K.   During   a   33-week heating season, the average temperature   difference across the   windows   is   7 oC.
(a)   For   both   types of   glazing, calculate the   total   heat loss during the   heating season.   (5.868GJ; 3.144GJ)
(b)   Obtain   current   figures   for   the   cost   of   electrical   energy   and   the   approximate   cost   of   double   glazing   windows.   Estimate   the   number   of years   required    for   the   annual   fuel   saving to pay for the cost   of   the   double   glazing.
8.       The   average rates of   heat loss for   a   particular   house   are   1580W   total   fabric   loss   and   870W   ventilation   loss.
