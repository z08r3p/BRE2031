1.   A   room   is   cooled   in   summer   by   an   air   conditioning   system   that   provides   an   air   flow   rate   of   5m3/s   to   remove   heat   gains   (sensible)   of   50kW.    Room   air   temperature   is   maintained   at   23oC.   Derive the formula for calculating the supply air temperature and find its value. (the heat capacity of air can be considered as constant:    1005J /   (kg . K) ; air density: 1.2929kg / m3 at 273K).    (reference answer: about   14.9oC) 
2.   A   room   has   heat   gain   (sensible)   of   10kW   and   a   supply   air   temperature   of   10oC.       Find    the   supply air rate required to keep the room air temperature at 20oC. (reference   answer:   0.798m3/s) 
3. A four-st代 写BRE2031 – Environmental Science Tutorial IAQ and VentilationJava
代做程序编程语言ory commercial   building   is   to   be   mechanically   ventilated.    Air-handling   plant   is   to   be sited   on   the   roof. Each floor has   dimensions 20m×10m×3m and   is   to   have   6   air   changes   per   hour (ACH).   Of   the   air   supply,    10%   is    allowed   to   exfiltrate   naturally   and   the   remainder   (90%)   is   extracted   to   roof   level. The   supply   and   extract   air ducts run vertically within   a   concrete service shaft and   the   limiting   air   velocity   is    10m/s.   Estimate   the   dimensions   required   for   the   service   shaft. Square ducts are   to   be   used   and   there   is   to   be   at   least 150mm between the duct and any other surface.    (reference   answer: about   1680mmx   930mm)
